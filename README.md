# Console Application

Develop a console application that takes any string from the console and transforms each even-indexed letter 
to uppercase and each odd-indexed letter to lowercase.

## Logging with AspectJ

Implement logging for both the original and transformed string values using the AspectJ library.

## Dynamic Logging Control with JMX

Utilize JMX capabilities to enable and disable logging without restarting the application.

### Recommendations for Implementation:

- Ensure the aspect is bound to a specific method rather than the entire class during implementation.
- To simplify the implementation, global states controlling logging can be used.
